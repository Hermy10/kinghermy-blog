# Kinghermy Blog

Personal blog built with Astro and Tailwind. Posts live in `src/content/blog`, and each post can have a cover image at `src/assets/blogimages/<slug>/cover.jpg`.

## Getting started

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev` (opens on localhost)
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Preview built site: `npm run preview`

Update site settings in `src/consts.ts`, replace favicons/OG images in `public/`, and edit page copy in `src/pages` to fit your voice.
